What is this?
====

I'm done messing around with OpenGL.  Time to get to what I really wanted to focus on, DirectX. 
Here we're going to focus on rendering a scene.  Nothign special, nothign crazy. 
Not focusing on making a game, not going to worry about assembling a hundred little objects together. We'll make a scene in Blender, export it as one model. 

This things entire purpose is to get familiar with creating light sources, shading, and basic shaders like normal maps. All wiht Direct3D11
